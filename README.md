## 📜 Description
The **BMP Ellipse** project is a RISC-V assembly program that generates an ellipse and saves it as a BMP image file.

   Download RARS from the official [GitHub repository](https://github.com/TheThirdOne/rars).

2. **Clone the repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/MaciejCieslik1/BMPEllipse.git

3. Transfer files loned from github to the same directory in which file rars1_6.jar exists.

4. Run rars simulator with command:
   ```sh
   java -jar rars1_6.jar
    ```
   
## 🎯 Usage

1. **Open the project** in RARS by using the "File" menu or toolbar.

2. **Compile the project** by pressing `F3`.

3. **Run the project** by pressing `F5`.

4. **Provide the following arguments** to generate the ellipse:
